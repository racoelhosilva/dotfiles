## Disclaimer

This repository is a just a backup for some of my config files for Arch Linux, so there may be some dotfiles I haven't uploaded or updated. Ricing/customizing Linux is a never-ending task and my setup will probably never be completely finished, therefore this is just a reference and a simple showcase of the system which I daily-drive.

I am by no means a Linux expert and this is just a simple setup I made using some applications and configurations I found and adapted from the internet. There are a lot of things I want to experiment with, so this repository will definitely change over time as I learn more and more about new stuff.

> Hope you liked my setup :)  
> Have a great day :)
